**atto** is a compact, pure-functional, incremental text parsing library for Scala (if you're looking for **binary** parsing, please turn your attention to [scodec](https://github.com/scodec/scodec)). The **atto** API is non-invasive (nothing to extend!) and uses sensible and familiar abstractions. **atto** parsers are a fun and principled tool for everyday parsing.

```scala
scala> int.sepBy1(spaceChar).parseOnly("1 20 300").option
res0: Option[scalaz.NonEmptyList[Int]] = Some(NonEmptyList(1, 20, 300))
```

Current version is **0.5.3** and is available for Scala 2.10 (JVM only), 2.11, and 2.12 (JVM and Scala-JS).

### What's New?

Starting with **0.5.2** atto supports Scala-JS! Thanks Pepe Garc√≠a and Carlos Quiroz!

The **0.5.x** series is a **breaking** change from 0.4.x, but for most users the impact will be minor. The important changes are:

- **atto** no longer depends on scalaz. Instead you can select a compatibility layer (see below).
- `Parser` and `ParseResult` are now **invariant**, so you may need to add explicit type arguments in some cases.
- The Spire and scalaz-stream support libraries have been dropped for now. Please speak up if you need them.

### Getting Started

- Add **atto** as a dependency in your `build.sbt` file.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.tpolecat" %% "atto-core"  % "0.5.3"
```

- Add a compatibility layer for the FP library you are using (if any). If you wish to limp along with the Scala standard library there is a built-in compatibility layer and no extra dependency is needed.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.tpolecat" %% "atto-compat-scalaz71" % "0.5.3" // for scalaz 7.1
                       "org.tpolecat" %% "atto-compat-scalaz72" % "0.5.3" // for scalaz 7.2
                       "org.tpolecat" %% "atto-compat-cats"     % "0.5.3" // for cats 0.9.0
```

- Import stuff:

```scala
import atto._, Atto._, compat.scalaz._ // or compat.cats._
                                       // or compat.stdlib._
```

- Profit.

### Functional Programming Compatibility Layers

**atto** provides compatibility layers that abstract out the differences between various versions of various FP libraries. *This is an experimental design* that is intended to lessen the headaches associated with versioning and library dependencies. These layers provide three things:

1. **Instances** for typeclasses that are not used in **atto** but are useful for end users.
2. **Shims** for typeclasses that *are* used in **atto**.
3. **Modes** for return types that differ between libraries (`Xor` vs. `\/` for example.)

| Concept                | Stdlib Type      | Scalaz Type       | Cats Type         |
|------------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Disjunction            | `Either[A, B]`   | `A \/ B`          | `Either[A, B]`    |
| Non-Empty List         | `(A, List[A])`   | `NonEmptyList[A]` | `NonEmptyList[A]` |
| Monoid                 |                  | `Monoid[A]`       | `Monoid[A]`       |
| Higher-Order Semigroup |                  | `Plus[F]`         | `SemigroupK[F]`   |
| Functors               |                  | `Functor[F]`      | `Functor[F]`      |
| Monads                 |                  | `Monad[F]`        | `Monad[F]`        |
| Foldable               | `Traversable[A]` | `Foldable[F]`     | `Foldable[F]`     |

The **tl;dr** is that if you import the right compatibility layer everything should work as expected.




### Why atto?

**atto** differs from stdlib parser combinators in a number of ways:

- You don't have to extend a trait or implement any methods.
- There is no tokenizer; the input type is always `Char`.
- Abstractions are better defined, which leads to simpler, more general code. `Parser` is a scalaz `Monad` for example, which gives us a lot of helpful operations for free.
- Parsers are *incremental* which means you can evaluate whether a prefix of your input is "ok so far." This can be helpful when working with streams or interactive UIs.

It's not a big deal to construct and use **atto** parsers; use them in any situation where you might otherwise reach for regular expressions or raw string manipulation.

Although **atto** is 50 times faster now than version 0.1, it's still not the fastest parsing lib on the block. If you're doing massive data processing you might look at a heavier library like Parboiled2, or even a hand-built parser like those used in the fastest JSON libs. But for "everyday" parsing where you have to turn user input into something useful, **atto** is a friendly little library to use.
